A real-time accompanist (for now for piano ideally lol). Select right/left hand, then accompy tracks your tempo and accompanies automatically. Demo available [here](https://jasonmdong-accompy.hf.space/).

### Inspiration

A small project of mine that I always wanted to do. Had the idea two years ago but never got the motivation to implement it.
